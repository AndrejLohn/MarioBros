Created based on the code from Brent Aureli at https://github.com/BrentAureli/SuperMario, https://www.youtube.com/user/Profyx/featured.

Mario Bros mobile app exercise. Just for fun and to kill my time when in public transportation. Tutorial teaches about viewports and advanced use of the libGDX development framework as well as sprite maps.
